# CRUD-Operation
## Introduction

CRUD operations are essential for managing data in various applications. In this project, we demonstrate how you can use GitHub's REST API to perform CRUD operations on data stored in a GitHub repository. Each operation corresponds to a specific HTTP method:

- **Create:** POST
- **Read:** GET
- **Update:** PATCH
- **Delete:** DELETE
